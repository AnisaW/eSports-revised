    <h1>Popularity</h1>
    <h2>How/Why</h2>
    <p>ESports is starting to rise in recognition. Thanks to constant tech improvement, the addictive quality of
      videogames, and the option to be social with other people that share a similar interest. Gaming technology
      companies are constantly trying to create better versions of their products, either in visuals/animations or
      the systems themselves. Videogames as a whole are known for being called "addicting". There's something about
      them that makes players feel like they can keep going for a couple more hours (it should if it's a good game).
      People get a thrill out of trying to beat opponents or watching really skilled players battle it out. Videogames
      also give people the opportunity to meet other players. It's fun being able to discuss characters or moves or even
      playing against them. Getting the opportunity to challenge new opponents is pretty exciting. </p>

    <h2>Where</h2>
    <p>Many tournaments are held in places like the United States, Australia, China, and South Korea. There are also
      international ones where teams have to get through certain stages in order to advance.
      </p>
    <h2>Streaming</h2>
    <p>Many players use streaming as a way to get themselves into the gaming community. They video themselves playing
    games, either just to show off certain moves, do a walkthrough tutorial or rage about what happened to them. It's
  not hard to get to the videos and anyone can watch them. Anyone can make an account and start streaming too.</p>
