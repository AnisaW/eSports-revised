    <h1>Sport or Not Debate</h1>
    <h2>Why is There a Debate?</h2>
    <p>People are just arguing about what can be considered a "sport". Does a sport have to be just physical
    activity? Or is all in the competitive aspect? People can get really heated on what ESports should be.</p>
    <h2>Yes Sport</h2>
    <p>Many people say that videogames involve similar characteris to the physical sports. Videogame players need
    a significant amount of hand-eye coordination, focus, and a desire to win the competition. This is very true for most, if not all the
    games played in the tournaments. Others also say that as long as
  there's some kind of competing going on it should be considered a sport.</p>
    <h2>No Sport</h2>
    <p>People on this side consider videogames nothing more than things that destroy brain cells and spread laziness. All people do
    is sit and stare at a screen. Nothing that benefits the health of the person involved. </p>
